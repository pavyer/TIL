Resources that are useful and have stuff worth remembering


### 1. Short animated video on how the web works at a very big picture level
https://vimeo.com/128575085  
  
**Key words from the video**
1. Network -- connecting all the nests together with wires.
2. Protocols -- Predefined and agreed upon means of exchaning info or messages across the network. Can't just send some aribitrary signal over the network and have it be understood
3. Packets -- break up messages to send. has to and from info and instructions on how it fits together with other packets to make the actual message.
4. IP Addresses -- each nest has a unique address
5. DNS servers -- Giant address books for looking up the destination nest
6. Routers -- for moving packets across the network 


### 2. Short animated video on how search works at a very big picture level  
https://vimeo.com/128575084  
  
**Key words from the video**
1. Search engine -- Program for search
2. Web crawlers -- Search engines use these. Programs that go to the web and link from one page to the other and keep on doing that. They send a copy of each of the pages they've crawled through to the main search engine.
3. Index -- The engine builds an indes of words contained on each of the pages
4. Algorithms -- Applies algorithms to the index to find the best fitting and relevant results for your search
5. Relevant results ^^
6. Ranking -- Search engine ranks all relevant results so you've the highest quality results from search
7. Quality of web page -- how often updated, how well written, how well linked -- determines search ranking

### 3. One of the best one page guide to what the internet is and how it works from MDN    
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work#Summary  
  
Can't really do justice to the write up through a summary. The one page is a really summary of the internet and the web and provides a really good understanding and model for reasoning about the internet and the services built on top of it, of which the Web is an example.
  
1. Difference between router and modem?
2. What is a router?
3. What is a modem?
4. Differentiate between the internet vs the Web.
5. In what way are Web, Email and IRC similar? (Services built on top of Internet.)
6. How do we keep track of all the computers connected to the internet?
7. What's a domain name?
  
Internet is simply a network of networks. And you can keep on scaling this and keeping on adding networks and keep on linking the networks. And run whatever service you want to over the network. Web, email, IRC, FTP or some other service. SSH is a protocol not a service. There's a SSH daemon or service on SSH servers to which SSH clients connect. 

### 4.Ok guide to how the internet works without too much of the details, but the right model for understanding the web and internet    
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc&feature=youtu.be&t=46s  
  
Redundant after the first three

### 5.Difference b/w common terms. Ehh    
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Pages_sites_servers_and_search_engines#Summary  
  
Worth a quick skim.

### 6. Explanation of client-server model of web from MDN. Ehh    
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works#Clients_and_servers  

### 7. Entertaining and very informative video on how DNS works  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72snZctFFtA&feature=youtu.be&t=45s  

### 8.DNS from MDN. Pretty well written. Slightly differs in how it presents implementation when compared to the above video.
This seems to hide the details.  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name#How_does_a_DNS_request_work  

### 9. One of the best books on HTTP
