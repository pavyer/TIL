**Types of output from a command**  
> As for the return value, know that you get three different kinds of responses from a program: standard output, standard error, and exit code. The latter is 0 for success and non-0 for some error (for most programs that do matching, 1 means not found and 2 and up mean some kind of usage error). In traditional Unix you redirect the output from grep if you only want the exit code; with GNU  grep you could use the -q option instead, but be aware that that is not portable. Both traditional and GNU grep allow -s to suppress standard error, but there are some differences in how the two handle it; most portable is grep PATTERN FILE >/dev/null 2>&1.

**Enclosing a command in backticks in variable assignment**  
> Use of Backtick symbol (`) in shell variables :
The backtick allows you to assign the output of a shell command to a variable. While this doesnâ€™t seem like much, it is a major building block in script programming.You must surround the entire command line command with backtick characters:

testing=`date`

The shell runs the command within the backticks and assigns the output to the variable testing.

**Using curly braces around shell variables**  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8748831/when-do-we-need-curly-braces-around-shell-variables
`var=10` for assignment
    ```
    $var      # use the variable
${var}    # same as above
${var}bar # expand var, and append "bar" too
$varbar   # same as ${varbar}, i.e expand a variable called varbar, if it exists.
    ```
